1. import hook
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

2. use effect
    useEffect(fn) // fn is the the effect
    useEffect(() => {
        document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
     });

3. cleanup: effect returns a function, React will run it when it is time to clean up(before the component is removed from the UI) 

4. fired:  both after the first render and after every update.

5. firing condition: 
     useEffect(fn,[prop1, prop2])
     useEffect(fn,[])
