generating unique IDs that are stable across the server and client

useId is not for generating keys in a list. Keys should be generated from your data.

For multiple IDs in the same component, append a suffix using the same id, dont use multiple useId in one component:

    ```const id = useId();
    ```<label htmlFor={id + '-firstName'}>First Name</label>
    ```<input id={id + '-lastName'} type="text" />


an id that **per instancace** of an component is consistant.
