def: Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. 

caution: Hooks don’t work inside classes 

rule: Only Call Hooks at the Top Level > Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.

rule: Only Call Hooks from React Functions (function components and custom hooks)

reason for the rules : React relies on the order in which Hooks are called. 




hooks in general: 

    useState:                   Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.
    useEffect :                 perform side effects in function components:
    useContext

    useReducer
    useCallback
    useMemo
    useRef
    *useImperativeHandle
    useLayoutEffect
    *useDebugValue
    useDeferredValue
    useTransition
    useId

    *useSyncExternalStore
    *useInsertionEffect

    **useParams**
