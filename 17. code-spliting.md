bundle :  following imported files ==> mergininig inito one single file ==> on page load ==> all ready

code-split: goal is to imporove performance of the app 
            without reduce the amount of code 
            by only load code the user needs 

how : 

    1. dynamic imports :  
    webpack will start code-split
    import("./math").then(math => {
        console.log(math.add(16, 26));
    });

    2. react lazy :  render a dynamic import as a regular component.
    const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));
    React.lazy takes a function that must call a dynamic import(). This must return a Promise
    The lazy component should then be rendered inside a Suspense component,which allows us to show some fallback content (such as a loading indicator) while weâ€™re waiting for the lazy component to load.

    1. Error boundaries:        lazy load fails dues to network failure, tirggers err
    2. startTransition:         keep old ui in place till new one is loaded
    3. suspense and fallback :  The lazy component should then be rendered inside a Suspense component, 

route-based : codee split is a good place to start

const Home = lazy(() => import('./routes/Home'));
const About = lazy(() => import('./routes/About'));
 <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </Suspense>


react lazy does not support neamed import at the moment, use intermediate moudle to reexport

intermediate :  export { MyComponent as default } from "./ManyComponents.js"; 
lazy:           const MyComponent = lazy(() => import("./MyComponent.js"));


code-split only if its necessary
